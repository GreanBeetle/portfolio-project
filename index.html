              <p>As an adult, that old Hemingway quote has seen me through many a day. I'm John, 37, Portland-native, and someone who identifies on Twitter as a runner, reader, writer, and cinephile. The path leading from college to Epicodus has been long and checkered, but the one thing that has held true is writing. I love it. I have worked as a paralegal, a construction worker, a cook, a mail carrier, a mental health tech at a psychiatric hospital, and for many years, as a caregiver caring for my autistic cousin, Jack. During all those jobs and all that time, I wrote. Fiction, mostly. I've completed three full-length novels and numerous short stories. One of the books, <strong>Bloodwood</strong>, is self-published. Feel free to check it out on Goodreads <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11949572-bloodwood">here</a>. Another of my manuscripts, <strong>The Oddclock</strong>, a beautiful, six-hundred-page tome, was finished in 2016 and lies on my dresser awaiting drastic revision. One of these months I will get around to changing and publishing it. For now, though, I am dedicating myself to the exhilarating, non-stop world of programming and Epicodus. It is a world to which I am warming up. It is full of possibility, and it is bright.</p>

              <h2>Projects, Week One</h2>
              <h4><a href="https://github.com/GreanBeetle/Blue-Sands">Blue Sands</a></h4>
              <p>Here, my partner Misha Petrov (a most excellent fellow) and I spent all of Tuesday building a fictional resort website for our fictional resort, Blue Sands. We used HTML, CSS, gh-pages, branching in general, and even linked <span style="color:#3D9970">Google Maps</span>.</p>

              <h4><a href="https://github.com/GreanBeetle/Wikipedia-Rebuild">Wikipedia Rebuild</a></h4>
              <p>My partner Chris and I used bootstrap, HTML, and CSS in an attempt to rebuild Wikipedia's homepage.</p>
              <hr>
              <h4><a href="https://github.com/GreanBeetle/Mount-Hood">Mount Hood</a></h4>
              <p>Again using bootstrap, CSS, and HTML, Chris and I built a super simple website about ski resorts on Mount Hood. Here we paid much attention to turning the body opaque so that we could see the background image.</p>
